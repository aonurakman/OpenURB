### Results

Provided experiment scripts store experiment results in this directory, under the folder name determined by the **experiment identifier**.

The structure of this result data is demonstrated with some sample results provided in this directory. In summary, this data includes:
- Experiment configuration values (`exp_config.json`).
- Demand and route generation data. (XML and CSV files.)
- Tracked loss values for the used algorithm. (`losses/`)
- Episode-level data logs. (`episodes/`)
- Simulation statistics yielded by SUMO. (`SUMO_output/`)
- Experiment data visualizations from RouteRL. (`plots/`)
- Calculated URB KPIs, (`metrics/`)
- Population switch logs (if applicable). (`shifts.csv`)
- Runtime resource utilization statistics. (`runtime.json`)
